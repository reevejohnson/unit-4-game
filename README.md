# unit-4-game

RULES:
* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal. When they do click one, this updates the player's score counter.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player sees a new random number. Also, all the crystals have four new hidden values. The user's score (and score counter) resets to zero.

* The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. You do not need to refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
